# About me

I mostly go by ant, or JJJ.

## coding

I started coding in around 2022 and my first project was basically just a chat bypasser that I added to.

I basically skidded from 2022 - the middle of 2023, then I realized that I had learned enough to just do things on my own instead of stealing them.

I am still not very "experienced", but I do try my best to make my code the best I can.

## My current projects

I am currently working on Plasma Admin, and Plasma Eagler.

## Music

I listen to a lot of songs from brahman, an alis used by the artist "lil darkie" in 2016.

I listen to a few songs by elijah who, and atlas.

I also listen to a artist who only has a few songs with words, who goes by cawson or polo swag on soundcloud.
